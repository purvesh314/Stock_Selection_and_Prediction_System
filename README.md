# Stock_Selection_and_Prediction_System
System to select stocks and predict the returns using Technical Analysis &amp; Machine Learning techniques
We have focused on maximizing the alpha(excess return on investment portfolio) by using technical analysis plus machine learning algorithms.
Technical indicators like Simple Moving Averages, EMA, RSI, MACD, ADX etc. are used. These help to filter the stocks according to the current trends, reversals etc. 
Then machine learning techniques such as Linear Regression & LSTM are applied to big data from stock market to optimize our results. 
Thus we combined Algorithmic Trading, Machine Learning & Technical Analysis to maximize the alpha. Experimental results confirmed that the use of these techniques can help to select top performing stocks that outperform the market by a huge margin.
